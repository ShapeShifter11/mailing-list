# mailing-list

## mailing list routine using doubly linked lists

when started the program displays a menu of options from which the user can chose 

``` c
    "1. Enter a name\n"
    "2. Delete a name\n"
    "3. List the file\n"
    "4. Search\n"
    "5. Save the file\n"
    "6. Load the file\n"
    "7. Quit\n" 
    
```
    
while active the program saves the entries on dinamicly allocated memmory. 
If the `save` option is chosen from the menu it will create a binary file on which the entries will be saved.
`load` is the other file function which will load an already existing binary disk file.
